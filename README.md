# AVcontrol
An AV controller for IR devices

This is a controller for my Smartthings home entertainment System.  I have an Onkyo mixer and a Ben-Q projector connected to an Arduino Uno by an IR led and RS232.

Pin connections (confirm these are working)
9 - IR led
1 - TX on an RS232 connection

When working on a new copy of the Arduino software and using the IR library you have to delete the default Arduino IR robot library that comes with it.
